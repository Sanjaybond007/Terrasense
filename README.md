## Problem Statement
-  Soil Health Degradation:  Inadequate knowledge of nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) affects soil quality and crop yield.
-  Unpredictable Weather Patterns:  Poor planning for irrigation and crop management due to fluctuating weather conditions.
-  Limited Access to Technology:  Farmers lack access to advanced technology and real-time data hindering their decision-making capabilities.
-  Late Detection of Crop Diseases:  Delayed identification of crop diseases leads to substantial harvest losses.
-  Fragmented Information:  Difficulty accessing comprehensive localized agricultural advice due to scattered information sources.
-  Informed Decision-Making Challenges:  These issues collectively impede farmers' ability to make informed decisions and optimize farming practices.
-  Impact on Sustainable Agricultural Growth:  The cumulative effect of these challenges undermines the potential for achieving sustainable agricultural growth.
